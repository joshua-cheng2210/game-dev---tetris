# game-dev--tetris-
i tried building tetris using python's turtle library

controls:
- left, right   -> to move the puzzle block left and right respectively
- down          -> drop the puzzle block
- space         -> rotate the puzzle block clockwise

goals
- arrange the puzzle blocks neatly using appropriate controls
- prevent stacking the puzzle block from stacking too high (your puzzle tower will COLLAPSE!!!)
- if you sucessfully filled a row with the puzzle blocks, the row will be removed and you will get some points.
- +4 points for evry block that can be placed below the height limit
